Hope to get out of the course: further understanding of students' ways of thinking, especially approaches that differ from the computer science mindset; improved ability to help students strengthen their computation thinking; knowledge that students have finished the class with a better understanding of computer science and better able to incorporate computers into their fields of interest

Project ideas: interactive fiction; interactive music; tile-based video game; physics simulation; multilingual social media with translation aids, minimal CAD interface for a 3D printer

Hope to get out of the course: The knowledge to start learning about coding and technology on my own.  The ability to make myself more efficient by utilizing computers

Project ideas: A calander/daily planner/task that I actually like.  A voice command system ("computer, open homework folder") would also be cool, but that would probably be on the OS.
